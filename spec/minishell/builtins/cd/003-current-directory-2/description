The purpose of this test is to check that using a relative path to the current directory as argument with the builtin `cd` results in not changing the current directory. In this test, the expansion `${GLOBAL_TMP_DIRECTORY##*/}` results in the name of the current directory, so that doing `cd ../${GLOBAL_TMP_DIRECTORY##*/}` is equivalent to do `cd .`. The environment variable must not be changed.
