The purpose of this test is to check that the Shell waits for the last command specified in a pipeline to complete, before continuing its execution. In this test, the first command of the pipeline takes a longer time to complete than the second command, so that the output should appear in a reverse order. The Shell should wait for twice processes to complete before launching the third command.
